# My Awesome Project
This is my codewar section, completing a codewar everyday to prepare myself for more complicating task. 


**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Express, OOP.


## Lessons Learned:

I learn something new everyday with solving a codewar, hence me doing one everyday (sometimes two).
I love learning new methods and what they can do, and simplifying the complexity.

## Examples:
Take a look at these couple examples that I have in my own portfolio:
